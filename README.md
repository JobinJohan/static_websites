# My static websites
These websites are made in pure HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript without using any web framework (check the other projects on my Github for that). Their main goal is to present each company, to show the services they offer and to illustrate their premises.

# The list
* [JK-Barber](https://jk-barber.ch)

This responsive website was done for a barber in Fribourg. It provides all necessary information about the shop, shows pictures of the hairdresser's salon and offers the possibility to customers to book an appointment online (using flexybeauty.com). Furthermore, thanks to various SEO techniques, the website appears in the first results on Google, which allowed the company to gain visibility.
* [Zenithude](www.zenithude.ch)


This responsive website was done for a Beauty salon in Matran. Emphasis was placed on the presentation of the different services proposed by the beautician. It also provides a form to book an appointment online, which helps the company's organization.
* [Codes-Postaux.ch](www.codes-postaux.ch)

This responsive website provides a front-end access to the swiss location API that I have implemented. It allows the user to find the zip code of any swiss town or to find the name of a town given its zip code.
